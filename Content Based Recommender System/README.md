# Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System repository! This project aims to build a content-based recommendation system to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and efficient movie recommendation system using a content-based filtering approach. This system will analyze various features of movies, such as genres, cast, director, and plot summaries, to provide personalized recommendations.

## Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook included in this repository, `Movie recommendation system (content based).ipynb`, contains the entire workflow of building the recommendation system. This includes:

- Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Feature Extraction and Engineering
- Building the Recommendation Model
- Evaluation of the Model
- Generating Recommendations

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib

Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib
